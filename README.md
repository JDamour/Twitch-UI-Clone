# Motivation

I was browsing Twitch one day looking for a good coding stream and relized how intricate their homepage UI was. I figured that this was a good time to finally use the tool I kept hearing about; Storybook. Overall, it turned how to be really helpful for the more detailed components/sections. Considering that some of the components took hundreds of lines of CSS the time I saved not waiting for a webpack config or CRA to rebundle everything was certainly noticeable. Also, It was a good introduction to TypeScript seeing that it wasn't very logic or prop heavy. I plan on using TypeScript in all my future projects & Storybook in projects that I feel it will be helpful for.

## Stack
